Customer segmentation is a marketing strategy used to group customers based on shared characteristics. The iFood dataset contains customer information such as demographics, spending behavior, and product preferences, making it ideal for segmentation analysis.

Key Steps in Customer Segmentation
Data Preprocessing:

Handle missing values and duplicates
Convert categorical data into numerical format
Scale numerical features for consistency
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):

Identify key patterns in customer spending and behavior
Use visualizations (histograms, scatter plots) to understand distribution
Feature Selection:

Select relevant attributes like income, spending score, frequency of purchases, and customer loyalty metrics
Clustering Methods:

K-Means Clustering: Groups customers based on similarity in spending behavior
Hierarchical Clustering: Creates a tree-like structure of customer segments
DBSCAN: Useful for detecting outliers and dense clusters
Evaluating Clusters:

Use Elbow Method or Silhouette Score to determine the best number of clusters
Analyze cluster characteristics to label segments (e.g., "High Spenders," "Budget Shoppers")

Conclusion
Customer segmentation helps businesses tailor marketing strategies, improve customer engagement, and enhance sales. Machine learning techniques like K-Means make it easier to identify meaningful customer groups.
